I'm Nussara Tieanklin or Firn. I am a Ph.D. Student, advised by <a href="https://kurti.sh/" class="button link">Professor Kurtis Heimerl</a> in the <a href="https://ictd.cs.washington.edu" class="button link">Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD) Lab </a> at Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington (Seattle, WA).

My research interests lie within the umbrella of Data Science for Social Good using mixed methods research and machine learning approach. The current research in the area is included but not limited to analyzing the effects of air pollution on the motorcycle-taxi Grab workers in Southeast Asia.

I am also interested in using community networks bridging the digital divide. Aside from helping technical installations and community outreach in the <a href="https://seattlecommunitynetwork.org/" class="button link">Seattle Community Network</a>, I also conduct qualitative researches, help with installations, teach technical workshops, and expand community outreach.

Let's exchange ideas and opportunity here at <a href="mailto:nussara@cs.washington.edu" class="button link"> nussara [at] cs.washington.edu</a>.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
