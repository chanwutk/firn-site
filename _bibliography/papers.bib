abstract = {This paper presents a mixed-methods study of app-based motorcycle taxis in Thailand to explore the social dynamics of rideshare drivers and their exercised autonomy both through social pressure and a hostile work environment. As motorcycle taxis are open-air vehicles, drivers can be exposed to prolonged air pollution and other weather events, potentially impacting their health. In an initial quantitative study of server-side rideshare logs, we unexpectedly found that drivers do not exercise the autonomy provided by their rideshare platform to avoid air pollution events. This prompted a follow-on investigation through semi-structured interviews of both drivers and passengers in three provinces to explore why these drivers fail to experience the autonomy promised by gig-work in this context and elucidated further examples this lack of autonomy experienced by drivers. Our study sheds light on the social context that may constrain a driver's agency, including financial pressures, weather conditions, conflicts with local taxi organizations, and a false perception that drivers need to work around the ride assignment algorithm to avoid being blacklisted. We find that when leveraging app-based rideshare opportunities, drivers simultaneously perceive increased flexibility in their work hours and a lack of agency to prioritize their health and safety. We conclude with a discussion on potential interventions aimed at mitigating the forces preventing drivers from exercising their autonomy.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
